# ClockService
This is all the labs for cmu18842 distributed system.

In lab 0, we built a message passer on top of tcp connections. 

In lab1, we developed facilities to track events using Logical and Vector Clocks, together with a logging application.
 
In lab2, we implemented the casual ordered, reliable multicast function.

In lab3, we maintained a distributed lock among all the nodes to share one critical section globally.
